17 Show'd like a rebel's whore. But all's too weak;
19 Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
13 The multiplying villainies of nature
11 And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald,--
14 Do swarm upon him,--from the Western isles
46 I cannot tell:--
10 As two spent swimmers that do cling together
18 For brave Macbeth,--well he deserves that name,--
27 As whence the sun 'gins his reflection
23 And ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,
30 Discomfort swells. Mark, King of Scotland, mark:
12 Worthy to be a rebel,--for to that
34 With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men,
35 Began a fresh assault.
38 Yes;
42 So they
21 Like valor's minion,
24 Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,
15 Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;
25 And fix'd his head upon our battlements.
31 No sooner justice had, with valor arm'd,
28 Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break;
20 Which smok'd with bloody execution,
33 But the Norweyan lord, surveying vantage,
43 Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:
41 As cannons overcharg'd with double cracks;
39 As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.
32 Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,
22 Carv'd out his passag tTill he fac'd the slave;
45 Or memorize another Golgotha,
29 So from that spring, whence comfort seem'd to come
40 If I say sooth, I must report they were
16 And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
47 But I am faint; my gashes cry for help.
9 Doubtful it stood;
44 Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,
